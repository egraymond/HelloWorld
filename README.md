# Overview

- I want to push my programming limits with every project I create. As a software engineer, I wanted to create the best ideas in my mind and in the way that I want to accomplish them. Efficency is key.

- This software is a simple "Hello World!" program but with a few added aspects. I wanted to display any text (by default, "Hello World") on each line with an added letter until the phrase ends. 

- The reason I created this is because as a start of my portfolio, I wanted to start with something simple, but with an adjustment on how I wanted to do it.

# Development Environment

- My knowledge on C# isn't where I wanted it to be, so I used AI to give me the rundown of the language and gave me example functions and basic rundowns of methods I can use for the project. I did not use AI to write the program, I used it to give me effective methods to accomplish a task. For example, I could've create the same program using lists, rearranging the list and creating a loop that goes through each interval of the list. Instead, AI showed me that **substrings** can be used and can accomplish the same task within a single line instead of an extensive list. 

- I used C# for this program, there's a few things I want to accomplish and is ran on C#, so the more practice I can get on this language, the better.
